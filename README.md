The main purpose of this project is to edit this website to be more inviting to those with disabilities and socio-economic restrictions. The second purpose of this project is to clean up the code for developers after.

I will accomplish the first task by:
    1) Making sure the existing code is functional.
    2) Replacing generic tags to more semantical ones.
    3) Rewriting paragraphs to be more "to the point".

I will accomplish the second task by reducing redundant or useless code from both the HTML or CSS.
